## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **CSV table viewer**: CSV and TSV files now open in a dedicated tabular viewer — `QTableView` backed by a custom `CsvTableModel` (`QAbstractTableModel`) renders rows and columns directly without loading the full file into a text widget; auto-detects separator via `csv.Sniffer` (fallback `,`); tries `utf-8-sig` → `utf-8` → `latin-1` encoding chain; large files paginated at 2 000 rows per page with `◀ [N] / M pages ▶` navigation; control bar provides: `⊞ Table` / `☰ Raw` view toggle, separator selector (`auto / , / ; / tab / |`), `Header` checkbox to treat first row as column names, `Edit` checkbox (double-click or Enter to edit cells in-place, auto-saves on uncheck via atomic `os.replace` temp-file write), search with `▲ ▼` navigation and yellow cell highlighting across the current page and total match count across all rows, zoom buttons (`➖ / ➕`) in Raw mode; Raw view shows the original file bytes (not reconstructed) with text highlight search; status bar shows file size, row count, column count, detected separator and file permissions
- **Interactive installer** (`install_purr.sh`): single installer with a `whiptail` checklist replacing the `install.sh` + `install_full.sh` two-script workflow; all optional components enabled by default — Voice support, AI Skills (git submodules), Ollama, aichat, Docker, Open WebUI image, WebMap image; user can toggle each individually before confirming; Docker is auto-added when Open WebUI or WebMap is selected; `--auto` flag installs everything non-interactively (CI/scripts); shows installation plan before start and full summary after; `install.sh` and `install_full.sh` remain unchanged
- **PDF file viewer**: PDF files now open in a dedicated in-app viewer with page navigation (◀ ▶), zoom controls (buttons + Ctrl+Scroll, range 25%–400%), and an "ℹ Info" button that opens a separate window with six sections — File Info (PDF version, page count, encryption status, permission flags, PyMuPDF metadata: title/author/subject/keywords/creator/producer/dates), Metadata exiftool (async), Structure (table of contents up to 10 entries, annotations by type, form widget count, embedded files with sizes), Embedded URLs (all hyperlinks extracted per page), IoC Scan (xref-level scan for `/JS`, `/JavaScript`, `/OpenAction`, `/AA`, `/Launch`, `/SubmitForm`, `/GoToR`, `/GoToE`, `/RichMedia`, `/XFA` — grouped by key with xref numbers), Integrity (MD5 + SHA256 with copy buttons, async); "↗ Open in system viewer" button in title bar; powered by `PyMuPDF` (`fitz`) and `exiftool`; graceful fallback message if PyMuPDF is not installed
- **Video file viewer**: video files (mp4, mkv, mov, avi, wmv, flv, webm, m4v, 3gp, ogv, mpeg4) now open in a dedicated in-app viewer with playback controls (play/pause/stop, seek bar, volume) and an "ℹ Info" button that opens a separate window with: file info (duration, resolution, FPS, codec, bitrate, size, permissions), metadata panel powered by `exiftool` (GPS coordinates marked with 📍, encoder, creation date, device make/model, all OSINT-relevant fields shown first), and an integrity section with MD5 + SHA256 hashes (copyable) plus a size/duration anomaly check; "↗ Open in system player" button opens the file in the default system player; powered by `QMediaPlayer` + `QVideoWidget` (PyQt6 QtMultimedia) and `exiftool`
- **Audio file viewer**: audio files (mp3, flac, ogg, wav, aac, wma, opus, aiff, aif, aifc, oga, mp2) now open in a dedicated viewer with a full playback player (play/pause/stop, seek bar, volume), an "ℹ Info" button that opens a separate window with five sections — File Info (mutagen: duration, bitrate, sample rate, channels, format, permissions; exiftool technical fields: ChannelMode, BitrateMode, LameVersion, LameEncoderSettings, VBR info, ReplayGain, VendorString, BWF broadcast fields), Raw Frames (ID3 version/size/padding, APIC cover art with size, PRIV private frames with owner identifier, GEOB embedded objects, TXXX custom fields, UFID MusicBrainz identifiers, URL frames, ID3v2 date frames, FLAC audio MD5 signature, OGG/FLAC vendor string), Metadata Tags (all ID3/Vorbis/MP4 tags in OSINT priority order), Metadata exiftool (LAME encoder settings, VBR method/quality, ChannelMode, BWF originator/UMID/CodingHistory for broadcast WAV, CreateDate, MIMEType), Integrity (MD5 + SHA256 hashes with copy buttons, size/duration anomaly check, steganography indicators: large ID3 header, unusual padding, multiple/oversized APIC frames, GEOB presence, large PRIV payload, FLAC MD5=0); "↗ Open in system player" button in title bar; powered by `pygame` (playback), `mutagen` (metadata) and `exiftool`
- **Syntax highlighting**: all 19 hand-written regex highlighters replaced by a single `PygmentsHighlighter` backed by the Pygments library — 500+ languages supported, edge-cases handled by the community, colors still driven by `qss_QPainter` theme
- **Syntax highlighting**: files with unknown extensions (`.yaml`, `.toml`, `.css`, `.rs`, `.ts`, `.env`, `Dockerfile`, `Makefile` etc.) now auto-detect language via `guess_lexer_for_filename()` and receive syntax highlighting automatically
- **File icons**: unknown extensions now show a neutral icon instead of "unsupported"; the unsupported icon is reserved for 62 known binary/non-openable formats (video, audio, archives, executables, fonts, 3D assets etc.)
- **HTML viewer**: three view mode buttons (`</>` code, `◫` split, `≡` preview) added before the browser button — split view is the default

### Fixed

- **CSV file viewer**: opening `.csv` files caused a ~10-second freeze followed by SIGSEGV (exit code 139) — three root causes fixed: (1) duplicate orphaned `QScrollArea` in `load_file()` (first scroll was created as parent of `container`, then a second scroll was created and `container` reparented to it, leaving the first scroll attached to `execution_tabs` as a ghost widget); (2) `parent_ref = getattr(self.worker, "parent", None)` in `_on_finished` accessed the worker C++ object after `deleteLater()` may have already destroyed it — replaced with `self.parent` which is always valid; (3) redundant `self.thread.quit()` call at the end of `_on_finished` (thread already quits via `worker.finished.connect(th.quit)`) — removed to avoid double-quit on an already-finishing thread
- **Audio file viewer**: `mutagen` missing from both `install.sh` and `install_full.sh` — caused duration to display `/0:00` and seek slider to do nothing on fresh installations (`_duration_sec` stayed `0.0`, which caused the seek guard `if self._duration_sec <= 0: return` to fire); added `mutagen` to both pip lists
- **Audio file viewer**: seeking in WAV files did nothing — `pygame.mixer.music.play(start=X)` does not support frame-level seeking in WAV format; fixed by slicing the WAV at the target position using the stdlib `wave` module (reads frames from `int(pos_sec * framerate)`, writes remainder into a `BytesIO` with a valid WAV header, loads the buffer via `pygame.mixer.music.load(buf, namehint='.wav')`); non-WAV formats (MP3, OGG, FLAC) continue to use `play(start=X)` as before
- **PDF file viewer**: `pymupdf` missing from `install_full.sh` — the two installers maintain independent pip lists; added `pymupdf` to `install_full.sh` so PDF viewer works regardless of which installer was used
- **testfolder**: removed `usermodules/testfolder/` from git tracking — folder is now ignored via `.gitignore` and will no longer appear in the repository; files remain locally
- **PDF file viewer**: `Pdf_file` is a plain Python class (not a `QObject` subclass) — `installEventFilter(self)` raised `TypeError`; replaced with a dedicated `_CtrlScrollFilter(QObject)` helper that holds the zoom callbacks and is installed on the scroll area viewport
- **Audio/Video file viewer**: opening a tab no longer shifts the file tree splitter — tab page now returns `QSize(0, 0)` from `sizeHint()` and `minimumSizeHint()` so Qt treats it as having no preferred size; filename in the tab label clips gracefully and reveals itself as the splitter is widened
- **Audio file viewer**: pygame startup banner no longer printed to terminal on every application launch — suppressed via `PYGAME_HIDE_SUPPORT_PROMPT=1`
- **Audio file viewer**: integrity hashes (MD5/SHA256) were permanently stuck on "computing..." — `QTimer.singleShot` called from a `threading.Thread` has no Qt event loop so the callback never fired; replaced with a shared-dict result and a polling `QTimer` in the main thread
- **Audio file viewer**: duration showed `/ 0:00` for WAV files without ID3 tags — mutagen objects are falsy when tagless (`bool(audio) == False`) so the `if audio and audio.info` check silently skipped them; changed to `is not None`
- **Audio file viewer**: size/duration anomaly check triggered on every file — mutagen returns `info.bitrate` in bps (e.g. 320000) while `actual_kbps` was computed in kbps (~320), giving ratio ≈ 0.001; fixed by converting to kbps (`// 1000`) at storage time
- **Audio file viewer**: playback buttons disabled on file open — `SDL_AUDIODRIVER` set at module import time failed inside the Qt app context; replaced with a driver fallback chain tried at init time: `pipewire → pulseaudio → SDL auto-detect`
- **Audio file viewer**: in-app audio stuttering — switched SDL to native PipeWire driver (SDL 2.28+) and aligned mixer buffer to `max-quantum = 8192` from the PipeWire VM fix config
- **Terminal**: `pshelp` hint no longer printed in the terminal on startup — only the overlay widget remains
- **Security**: sudo password no longer stored in GNOME Keyring — now kept in a `bytearray` in RAM for the session duration and securely zeroed at shutdown via `ctypes.memset`; eliminates "Unlock Login Keyring" popup on application exit
- **Markdown preview**: zoom (buttons + Ctrl+Scroll) now scales images alongside text; images fit the preview width automatically and never upscale beyond natural size
- **Markdown preview**: content no longer cut off on file open without requiring a splitter resize; horizontal scrollbar removed to prevent flicker
- **Terminal**: split view labels corrected — "Split View Left-Right" and "Split View Top-Bottom"
- **Terminal**: zoom (buttons, Ctrl+Scroll, right-click menu) now works correctly in split terminals, including Zoom Reset option
- **Terminal**: commands executed in split terminals are now logged to `terminal_history.jsonl` (visible to `psfix`, `psnext`, `psreport`)
- **Terminal**: Pause Agent Monitoring now also pauses history logging for the split terminal in the same tab
- **Terminal**: `psopen` now opens files from split terminals the same way as the primary terminal
- **Terminal**: split terminal now receives silent variable/alias injection from Observable Panel (own FIFO assigned at creation, cleaned up on unsplit)
- **Terminal**: split terminal right-click menu now includes Find option with theme-aware search bar styling
- **Terminal**: reduced visual artifacts after search bar toggle and split/unsplit — improved repaint logic using `setTerminalFont` to trigger full character grid recalculation (known issue: artifacts may still appear in some cases)
- **psopen**: rewrote file opening to use OSC escape sequence protocol — fixes paths with spaces, eliminates race conditions between terminals
- **psopen**: directories now open silently in the default file manager (`xdg-open`)
- **psopen**: removed `PurrSh3ll opened >>` confirmation text from terminal output
- **Snippets**: placeholder dialog is now non-modal — other windows (terminal, tabs) remain accessible while filling in values; all placeholders shown at once in a single form
